A Google Calendar widget for viewing the daily [Guardian Lead Cartoons](http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons).

Inspired by the [XKCD Google Calendar widget](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=5cqlptmdlems7dk9u14hkqfrtv7drooo%40import.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London) by [Michael Bolin](http://www.bolinfest.com/)

This script writes out an ical file for Google Calendar to sync with. It collects the cartoon data from the [Guardian Cartoon RSS Feed](http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/archive/rss).
